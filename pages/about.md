# **About Me**

Hi my name is **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am an IT and Tech :computer: enthusiast, graduated from the University Of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam starting a new study at Codam - Amsterdam.

I am a skilled independent worker with an experienced team mindset from having worked at ING on Virtual Reality, Networking and Communication of Quantum Technology through gamification and as Technical Architect and Sublead Unity Developer at DTT - Amsterdam.

In my free time i like to:
1. Work out :muscle:
2. Read :books:
3. Cook: :curry:
4. Volunteer at the animal shelter: :dog2:
5. Work on hobby projects to learn more about the tools and design structures that in my opinion, a good game developer should know about.
