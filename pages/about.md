# **About Me**

I am a skilled independent worker with an experienced team mindset from having worked at ING Amsterdam on Virtual Reality, Networking and Communication of Quantum Technology through gamification and as Technical Architect and Sublead Unity Developer at DTT - Amsterdam.

In my free time i like to:
1. Work out :muscle:
2. Read :books:
3. Cook: :curry:
4. Volunteer at the animal shelter: :dog2:
5. Work on hobby projects to learn more about the tools and design structures that in my opinion, a good game developer should know about.
