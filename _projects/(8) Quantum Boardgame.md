# Quantum Boardgame

Working as JR IT Specialist-Application Developer after my internship I was able to learn about ECS in Unity and communication of Quantum Mechanics, being part of a team working on an web application to communicate the basics of Quantum Computing.  I did this together with a Quantum Engineering, a game designer and another game programmer.
