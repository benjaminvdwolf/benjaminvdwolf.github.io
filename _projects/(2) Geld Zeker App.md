# Geld Zeker App

---

Doing my minor in Zwolle I worked on a multidisciplinary project called Geld Zeker. Combining Art, Law, Communication, Social and IT studies we worked to create a mobile application that could help immigrants during their integration in dutch society. The problem to tackle: The dutch financial system.
