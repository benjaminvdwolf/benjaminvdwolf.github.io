# Bob's Mayhem

During the Global Game Jam NL 2021 I worked toghether with a team of friends from the University on a game called Bob's Mayhem. Bob's mayhem is about an employee at an airport matching luggage descriptions to luggage items on a very chaotic first day. Out of **93** entries we ranked **3rd** with 27 ratings (Score: 4.067).

During this project I worked on the drop of point and its interactions with the player, a **Scriptable Object Event System** for taking care of the gameplay events during the game and creation of a gameplay loop, making it possible to play through the game multiple times without closing the application.
