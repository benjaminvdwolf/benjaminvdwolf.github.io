# Math Recycler

Developed with kotlin in android studio, the mathrecycler is a simple game where you make decisions swiping a math statement right or left, asserting it to be true or false. You are able to customize difficulty and math operator and look at played games in your history list.

During the project I used a variety of libraries and techniques:
- Activities and Fragments
- ROOM local storage with Repositories
- Viewmodels and LiveData
- Remote data using the NumbersAPI
- Animations using Lottie Animation
