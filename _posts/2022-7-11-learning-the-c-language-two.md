description: In this short blog post I describe my learning of the C programming language as a consequence of me starting a new study at the Amsterdam Codam Coding College. This from the perspective of a C# developer.

As a C# programmer you are not always aware of how much the language does for you. Starting with C has made me realize how much tedious tasks there actually are during development if not handled for you.

Following from [Part 1](learning-the-c-language-one), I want to continue to talk about concepts/tools that I think C# makes easier when compared to C. Part 2 will be about:

- Makefile (re)linking vs C# compilation
- Pointers vs classes/structs

Disclaimer:
> At this point I have been programming in C for about 2 to 3 months so some of the information I am giving might not be complete or misses some nuance. If this might be the case, please send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-van-der-wolf-742305160) or [email me](mailto:benjaminvanderwolf@gmail.com). I am always willing to learn more.
